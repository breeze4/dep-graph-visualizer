# Tasks Checklist

## Notes
- No build system for frontend or backend
- Use vanilla JavaScript only (no frameworks)
- D3.js for interactive data visualizations
- Backend serves static files and provides API endpoints
- Frontend served on localhost via backend server
- Graph structure uses bidirectional adjacency list (imports/importedBy)
- Use `example/example-app/src/` as the test subject for testing the graph traversal mechanism. It is a vite/Typescript/vanilla app. Do not add any frameworks or external dependencies to this example.
- When working through a task list, check each completed task off as its done, before starting the next task. Only do one section at a time, then wait for further instructions.
