## Feature request/bug reports/tweaks to make:
* multi-select mode is weird: the purple modal flashes when shift key is held down. Also there is no visual indicator on the nodes that its being selected. Lets be really clear that the first click is selecting the target and the additional selects are the things we want to understand the interfaces of with respect to the target.
