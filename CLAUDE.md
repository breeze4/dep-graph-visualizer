# Working instructions

Never run the server or frontend, I will do all the running of apps

After doing a chunk of work, make sure to run the build with `npm run build` and check for any errors or warnings. Also run `npm run typecheck` to check the types/compile errors. Run `npm run lint` to check for linting. Run `npm run format` to do prettier. Lint and prettier after the build is clear of errors.
